# Parallel Computing Project with Dask and Multi-GPU Training 

Welcome to the repository that explores **parallel computing techniques**, utilizing the **Dask** library for CPU processing 🏗️ and **multi-GPU implementation** for medical image analysis.

## 🌍 Overview

This repository contains two main notebooks:

1. **📊 SUS Data Analysis with Dask**: Uses the Dask library to process and analyze large-scale healthcare data from the **Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS)** in São Paulo from 2008 to 2018. The focus is on demonstrating how Dask facilitates parallel processing on CPUs 🖥️, enabling efficient handling of large datasets.

2. **🖼️ Organelle Identification with BloodMNIST on Multiple GPUs**: Applies deep learning techniques to identify organelles in BloodMNIST images, leveraging multiple GPUs in parallel 🎮⚡. This notebook highlights how to distribute workload across multiple GPUs to speed up training and inference.
