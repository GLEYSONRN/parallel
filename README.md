# Parallel Computing Project with Dask and Multi-GPU Training 

Welcome to the repository that explores **parallel computing techniques**, utilizing the **Dask** library for CPU processing and **multi-GPU implementation** for medical image analysis.

## üåç Overview

This repository contains two main notebooks:

1. **SUS Data Analysis with Dask**: Uses the Dask library to process and analyze large-scale healthcare data from the **Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS)** in S√£o Paulo from 2008 to 2018. The focus is on demonstrating how Dask facilitates parallel processing on CPUs, enabling efficient handling of large datasets.

2. **Organelle Identification with BloodMNIST on Multiple GPUs**: Applies deep learning techniques to identify organelles in BloodMNIST images, leveraging multiple GPUs in parallel üéÆ‚ö°. This notebook highlights how to distribute workload across multiple GPUs to speed up training and inference.

## üìö Notebooks
